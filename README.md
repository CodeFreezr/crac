# CRaCC
CRaCC - Code-Riddles and -Challenges, -Collections:  

A polyglot List of Code-Riddles, Challenges, -Collections, -Puzzles, -Examples and -Snippets and more about plain sourcecode. Because code is poem, so cracc is like poetry slam.

---
For the moment it's just about  collecting all the stuff, perhaps later we will elevate this to an awesome-style list. Pleas feel free to new proposal via issue or better via pull request.
